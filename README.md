EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.1, I guess). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Make sure the localization files actually work, though they are few in number
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Difficulty settings that adjust the Omega's strength
- Move some of the Omega's bonuses to triggered modifiers, especially once difficulty settings are implemented
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Possibly some flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
