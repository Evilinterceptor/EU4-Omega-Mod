EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.6). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. The star of this update is the Omega's new shiny "Overwhelming" attitude, which kicks in once it earns 75 ducats a month and makes it hate all nations it has not subjugated.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions more modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline 
- Possibly some flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
