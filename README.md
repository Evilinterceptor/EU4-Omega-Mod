EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.31). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. This version had a bunch of tweaks to make the Omega more consistent and powerful; thanks to diablo109 on the PDX forums for reporting several bugs.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Improve how the Omega handles being vassalized or the junior partner in a personal union
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Move some more of the Omega's bonuses to triggered modifiers
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Possibly some flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
