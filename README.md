EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.61). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. This is a very small update to ensure basic compatibility with El Dorado; to be followed by a more comprehensive update that takes advantage of the mod's functionality.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- For players on the hardest difficulty - an "Omegan Insurrection" disaster that swamps your country with special rebels that will spread Omegan culture and cores to your lands. A weaker version might be given to neighboring AI countries.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make more functions more modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline 
- Possibly some more flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
