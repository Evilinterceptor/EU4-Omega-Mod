EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.4). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. This version primarily improves how the Omega interacts with vassals and union partners - it's relatively kind if you're a human (or a sufficiently human-like AI), and completely evil if you're an in-game AI. 

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Move some more of the Omega's bonuses to triggered modifiers
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Make various functions more modular so you can add an Omega to other mods like Extended Timeline
- Possibly some flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
