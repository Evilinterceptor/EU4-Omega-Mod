EU4-Omega-Mod
=============

A mod for Europa Universalis IV that turns a random AI country into a ridiculously overpowered endboss. 

Currently in alpha (v0.3). Most basic functionality has been implemented, but there's a lot of room for further improvements. This version gives the Omega some more bonuses when it's small to reduce its odds of getting smooshed.

A list of the most important planned changes follows:

- Fix the initialization event's description in the localization files. I have absolutely no idea why this isn't working. Please help.
- Disable native mechanics for an Omega spawned from Native Americans
- Move some more of the Omega's bonuses to triggered modifiers
- Graphical enhancements, including a better flag, a tech group icon, and maybe new models/skins if we're really lucky
- Possibly some flavor events for humans dealing with the Omega to increase the depth of interactions with them?
