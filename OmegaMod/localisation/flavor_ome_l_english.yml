 flavor_ome.1.t: "Genesis of the Omega"
 flavor_ome.1.d: "Our country's citizens wake from horrible nightmares of demoniac conquest. While our scholars and clergy struggle to interpret this, scattered rumors from beyond our borders speak of a ruler giving their country over to a force more terrible than the Frank, the Turk, and the Mongol combined. It is unclear how long we have to prepare for its arrival."
 flavor_ome.1.a: "Oh dear."
 flavor_ome.2.t: "No Protectorates for the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.2.d: "This event occasionally turns any protectorates the Omega forms into straight up vassals, in an attempt to speed up its attempts at conquest."
 flavor_ome.2.a: "We must refrain from indirect rule"
 flavor_ome.3.t: "Free Explorers for the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.3.d: "I'm having trouble making sure the Omega takes the Exploration idea group. As a stopgap, they get a free explorer every now and then, so long as they have coastal provinces."
 flavor_ome.3.a: "Kludges are pretty great."
 flavor_ome.4.t: "The Omega has broken free!"
 flavor_ome.4.d: "In a display of pure spite and anti-rationality, the Omega has turned their back on the oaths of fealty they swore. \n This is actually a balance event. Until I can modify the Omega's AI, it will not free itself through war frequently enough for my tastes. If you're at the point where you're about to defeat the Omega, don't take halfway measures - just annex them."
 flavor_ome.4.a: "They will not surrender until we beat them into the ground."
 flavor_ome.5.t: "Assimilation at the hands of the Omega (AI)"
 flavor_ome.5.d: "Upon attempting to subjugate the Omega, our ruler has rapidly learned of the overwhelming superiority of their government's methods. Fire and blood pours forth from our magistrates' mouths, at least when they aren't pressuring us to redefine ourselves as Omegan subjects. It would appear they are possessed, and it appears we soon w..w...w... ALL GLORY TO THE OMEGA.\nThis event should only fire for the AI. If you see it during normal play, then your country is about to be annexed, and I sincerely apologize."
 flavor_ome.5.a: "Crud buckets! (Please report this)"
 omegan: "Omegan"
 omegan_desc: "With the Omegan technology group, technologies are 100% less expensive, albeit only via triggered modifier."
